The only language I had a basic grasp going in was python, but I started taking the web-development courses(currently 20% to certification) and have been able to fly through at my own pace. Mimo encourages learning through a healthy sense of challenge/competition but keeps it from becoming demanding. It challenges you just enough to keep you interested. Best part is the app is free, enacting a “lives system” like your typical phone game would. The lives(5 to be exact) are pretty much enough to get you through one day assuming you don’t go premium. Once you run out it’s roughly three hours for one heart, essentially encouraging coming back daily to learn. It also has a simple daily streak mechanic that further encourages daily involvement and the previously mentioned competition is a leaderboard that slightly encourages trying harder when learning. This has been the best experience I have ever had in my journey to learn how to program. Between the textbooks and other online courses, this is hands down my favorite experience.",5,False,BreadOne2Three,… And it’s all free,POSITIVE,python,"streak, competit, challeng, leaderboard"

Oh you one without wisdom. I have seen the light; I have been enlightened.” All that Mimo gives so freely couldn’t have been conceived in my wildest visions. Mimo... is like  heaven come to earth. It’s sleek design, a satisfying ui and, dare I say, Mimolicios leaderboard has inspired me each and every day to expand my brain capacity.  The Mimo experience; a hill with flowers atop, a place to call home, a place to call school. I have climbed passed my “peers”, with my intellectual prowess, easily shooting to the top of every leaderboard in my sight. I feel like a child, touching the face of God as my eyes are opened. This is what it all means. I feel like the summarians, national  superpowers that saw what the human capacity currently was, and didn’t except it: no, they rebelled against there primitive form and invented the basis for the advances we are able to make today. As I sit here, wrighting this reflection of the greatest peece of the puzzle that is our human experience: I reflect apon my life before Mimo, the melancholy state I was in. I don’t shame those who are experiencing a similar way of living; no, I call them, I offer them a hand  out of the dusty, well trodden rode they are crouched on, and say: “let me offer you something greater, something inspiring and powerful: let me grant you Mimo.”

Its a new day I decided to do a lesson in the middle of the night bc I stayed up. I’ve changed my goal to regular from serious as I got busier but still want to learn my python stuff to reach my Daily goal. I lost my streak 25th bc Christmas and I’ve been trying to earn daily rewards to repair it for the new year. I did my daily lessons few minutes ago and earned my 20 coins i needed to purchase a streak repair & it wouldnt let me, I got to 407 coins!! It wouldnt let me but the repair, im bummed out now. I was at 387 coins before todays lessons too. After I had enough to fix my lost streak day. And then the glitch happens! Please fix this! Also after updating the app, my circle progress bar with percent on how far I am on the course disappeared from my coding page, I loved seeing it where the lessons are & now I have to click the python drop down menu to see it.",2,False,Mee2212121,Earned coins & percent progress bar disappeared after latest update,NEGATIVE,python,"streak, progress"
28,2022-03-02 20:05:34,,"I literally downloaded this last night on a complete whim, and it’s so addicting that I’m already 20% through the python course. They break everything down in a way that’s extremely easy to learn even for complete beginners like myself, and gradually up the challenge the more you progress through your lessons. There’s also mini projects that come with each lesson to help you apply what you’re learning in a practical way. The pro subscription is more than reasonable for all of the material you learn, and lets you do as many modules as you want. I already recommended this app to everyone I could, and I’m so excited to keep learning more!",5,False,Hartley Porter,Fantastic app for beginners!,POSITIVE,python,"challeng, progress, break"

All of it is amazing except the hearts. You have 5 lives and if you get a question wrong, you get a life taken away. It’s kind of disappointing that you have lives when you really want to learn how coding/python works. If you run out of lives, you can buy lives with the in-game currency or wait.

I think it’s perfect to learn the basics but that’s about it. I give it 4 stars but if the lessons were longer and more in depth I’d give it 5 . Also I feel that the lessons are too short which you could easily finish before one month. I also think that some lessons teach you a brand new method or object and not enough reinforcement of previously learned material as it isn’t gradually added onto the lessons only slightly.",4,False,suckit57!,A Great start,NEGATIVE,python,competit

However in order to keep your streak you will need to avoid making mistakes. If you run out of hearts you have to pay for a premium plan to get more hearts. This is terrible design, you can get all the questions right but miss the last one on your last heart and goodbye streak. I thought it would be something like duolingo where you keep your streak if you still try the lesson even if you fail, but no you have to pay to keep it.
