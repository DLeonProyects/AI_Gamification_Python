Started in on the python course and am now around half way through it. Each lesson is nicely separated into specific parts. Not using the social sections much yet, but it looks like a bit of that as well for someone else to write about.

Code challenges are really stupid. Most of them (c# and python) are not about programming -  its about getting substring from index 13 to 17 (yes, stupid calculating chars by your finger), integer and decimal division, and prefix/postfix increment/decrement. Really? Also challenges are repeated very often. Two days and it became totally boring. Though lessons are pretty good.",4,0,1.0.2,2017-02-21 15:28:25,,,NEGATIVE,python,challeng
