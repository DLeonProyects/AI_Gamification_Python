1369,2022-10-04 16:32:58,"My wife is a data engineer and has been wanting me to learn a little bit about what she does, so I tried a couple of different options. This so far has been the best one. The information is concise and there is practice throughout each lesson. However, there is some information that I’ve learned from my wife and the book she used to learn python that contradicts the way they are teaching me, which is fine. There’s more than one way to get to answer, however she did say that as I progress these little differences will cause problems. Either way, I’ve been having a lot of fun learning what she does.

Additionally, I learn by having a lot of practice to implement what I’ve learned. I subscribed to the pro version because I was under the impression that I would have unlimited practice. However, that is not the case. I’ve completed over 20 lessons and the only practice I’ve had is the the built in code coach near the end of each lesson. I’ve yet to have an option for additional practice with new questions. This is a huge bummer for me and I will likely cancel my subscription because of it and just use the free version.",3,False,BlackSmithToo,Disappointed in Pro Version,"{'id': 32485044, 'body': 'Hey, Thanks for your feedback.

1381,2022-06-24 18:48:45,"You cannot restart a course which is a huge problem because you cannot review easily. I could care less about the point system.

My experience is with the python course(s) for the most basic things, the explanations are sufficient, but In my opinion, they don’t know how to teach in general. I study some psychology and am good at turning around and teaching things I learn. Many times the questions are confusing or try to get you solve something that hasn’t been explained well at all OR they intentionally make it so challenging that you basically are forced to give up and look at what other people are saying or look at the answer. I don’t have a problem with the right level of challenge because you grow from it, but if challenges are consistently too difficult, humans tend to give up (when you train a dog or a human baby, it is the same. Btw, usually the dog isn’t the problem. It is the trainer. Telling a dog they are a stupid idiot does nothing to make the dog better). About 3/4 of the topics, people in the comments explained the topic better than the app does.. I recently started watching bro code on YouTube. Much better. I was going to use this as a back up resource to refresh my memory of certain topics from a different perspective, but it is too much trouble.",2,False,Fushigimigi,Frustrated,"{'id': 30663362, 'body': 'Hey,\nThanks for your feedback.\nWe work tirelessly to improve our content, platform, and services by listening to and responding to members of our community.

1618,2018-08-30 18:20:25,"One of the best features of this app is the comment section. People are very helpful in explaining and expounding on concepts, ideas not fully covered in the lessons. Feel free to ask questions too. The community is uber helpful. I also noticed that there are coding challenges as well and you can exhibit code you’ve created in the playground. I use this to review stuff on python I’ve forgotten after not having used the language for about 10 years and it’s been refreshingly helpful.",5,False,plainjosh,Great app,,POSITIVE,python,challeng
1638,2018-06-19 17:09:38,"SoloLearn is really good- you get tons of coding courses for free. I’ve been using it for about two years now and it has rarely failed me. I recommend it first to anyone who asks me where they should learn to code. 

The Q&A is well-moderated and the courses are in good detail for the most part. The playground is a great place to test your code. All in all, Sololearn is a great tool if you want to test something really quick, or refer to a course if you are looking for quick information. This is especially useful when you have the app.

However, there are one or two problems I might report here in order that it gets fixed. In the mobile app, when you have the keyboard down in a code and click the < arrow button, it sees I havent saved the code and asks me to name it and save it. This is really useful, because without it I would have had too many projects lost because I never saved. However, it never prompts you if you have the keyboard up. For example, I was working on a project for over an hour on my mobile, and was expecting it to ask me to save when I pressed the < button (I had the keyboard up) and it never prompts me to save so all my progress was gone, which I was not expecting to happen. 

Also, some courses aren’t complete. The PHP course is missing a lot of important shadings revolving around opening and closing files.

I had spent long hard hours staring at a simple python program wondering why it wouldn’t work. It was a simple program: you input into one file, and the program puts the result in the output file. What would be an easy file error fix took me hours to troubleshoot (who knew that file.read() closes the file, resulting in errors if you want to read the file line by line?). Just these small tidbits of advice in the courses can save programmers lots of time.",4,False,Bill1971MD,"Its great, some problems though",,POSITIVE,python,progress

Example:  I have a gaming program I created with python and it asks questions as u go along to the point you have no idea what to input because, every input as multiple various outputs",4,False,Lycas25,Room for improvement,,POSITIVE,python,point
