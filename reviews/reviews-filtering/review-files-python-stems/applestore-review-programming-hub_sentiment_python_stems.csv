I took the fundamentals course just to check it out. I already know HTML and CSS. If I didn’t I wouldn’t have been able to figure out this course at all! It asked questions related to things it did not teach. At one point it registered my answer as incorrect even though I did not choose that answer. The text is also often grammatically incorrect, with words in the wrong order. They required me to rate the app only a minute into the course and there was no way out of it. Trying to share the certificate I earned was impossible. I got the pro version because the “for life” option seemed like a good deal and this app came highly recommended from a friend. I will not be using this app. I saw that some of these problems were described a year ago, and the developer said they would fix it. They did not. I would like to get my money back, and I certainly question my friend’s judgement now!",1,False,Quellcrist,Definitely buggy and strange,NEGATIVE,python,point

Still at it still saweet.

Just learning more at my speed no pressure

Learning C++ it is a different from python and Java so far.  Program Hub’s definition and breakdown of all the courses I have been learning are most exemplary.

Just starting Java all is good here.

Java completed this is totally mind blowing the ease of use while I am learning. SAWEET",5,False,mandude6771,ProgramingHub makes learning programming much easier than I expected.,POSITIVE,python,break
