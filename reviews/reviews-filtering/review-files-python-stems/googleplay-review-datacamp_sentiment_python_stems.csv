It's more expensive than Udemy, but it's obvious why. Production is very good. The USP for me was the interactive python shell. You're introduced to a concept via a video, then apply it using real data. You can learn at your own speed and complete a daily challenge on what module you're currently studying. Hugo is good at keeping you motivated, funny guy.",4,0,55.0.0,2022-06-24 10:36:23,,,POSITIVE,python,challeng

I've used this app to help me learn R and Python and because it's on my phone, I can learn while on the train, while waiting for an appointment or even sitting on my couch. I would love it if the app had quick reference guides that I can call up anytime or jump to a topic (like NumPy) so when I'm actually coding I can refer to DataCamp for help. I know cheat sheets are available on the web version. Also, how about a Pandas for python tutorial?",5,5,12.1.0,2019-03-23 23:39:59,,,POSITIVE,python,point

I've finished the introduction to python two times in a row and the progress is lost after I'm connected to the internet. I just want to see the intermediate course.

Their subscription structure, the app, the learning by doing mentality, their emails. They're really going from strength to strength to help people learn r and python. The app itself is a work in progress, but I value they've released it early to get feedback from users.
