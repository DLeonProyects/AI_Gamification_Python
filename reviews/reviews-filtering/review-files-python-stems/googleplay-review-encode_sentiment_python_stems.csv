Accidentally was installed in a few days, but yesterday I've buyed unlock for life-time(I hope) EncodePro, becouse it is at competitive price even by my poor in European context Bulgarian standarts. Every penny-worth app. Interactive at all. Full featured offline funktionality - tested, 5of5. Encode is like chatting with your favourite teacher who comments your answers and for extending knowledge give you tasks in historical background and facts, more intensive in Pro. 5of5. From didacting point of view 4.8of5. Why: I would like to see some kind of glossary apart although operators an syntax was explained via lessons and tasks to resolve. I hope this interpret triple or four [python, js, html & css] will be extend with other champions of InterpretLinguaCodes like PHP 'in battle', in competition to compilationative ones like Java and all C series. I think CompiLinguaCodes do one more needless and complicative stage in way from coding to execution ;-). Also I didn't note what version of Python learn here, in Encode (incl. Pro unlock) - whether 2 or 3th version or... I am wrong. Of course it will be a sweet cherry(ty) onto pie to learn both ones with explaining paralelism and aprior focus at Python 3. Most of all greetings to Upskew team for their great work! 5 stars from me.",5,1,4.5,2018-10-03 06:48:17,,,POSITIVE,python,"competit, point"

The description says it is POWERED by JavaScript  (which is both obsolete and just overall regarded as one of the worst languages in the coding community) and does not actually specify how to implement any of the code, how to run it, or again, what language. Does it need a compiler? Does it need an IDE? Does it run in a virtual machine like Java or on the hardware like C++? I have so many qustions, but there's nothing to indicate anything. Now, if it's all in the paid version, that's just low. Teach a person a language they can't use. Though, the Web section did save the app two stars. That was a lot more straight forward. Overall the UI looked good. But there's just so much missing that leaves the user who actually wants to use the language for something unsure of everything. They know a language, but not the name, or in what cases you should use it. Also, I feel ""this is a string. A string is letters in quotations"" is not the best way to teach. Maybe explain when it's used. I mean, I already know what a strong is because of my background in c++ and python and java, but people that are seeking a skill they have no experience with, they probably won't know a great deal. Yeah, you can amke a sentence without using ""char a = 'a';""",2,0,,2017-04-27 10:04:14,,,NEGATIVE,python,virtual
