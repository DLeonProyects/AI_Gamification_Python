The only language I had a basic grasp going in was python, but I started taking the web-development courses(currently 20% to certification) and have been able to fly through at my own pace. Mimo encourages learning through a healthy sense of challenge/competition but keeps it from becoming demanding. It challenges you just enough to keep you interested. Best part is the app is free, enacting a “lives system” like your typical phone game would. The lives(5 to be exact) are pretty much enough to get you through one day assuming you don’t go premium. Once you run out it’s roughly three hours for one heart, essentially encouraging coming back daily to learn. It also has a simple daily streak mechanic that further encourages daily involvement and the previously mentioned competition is a leaderboard that slightly encourages trying harder when learning. This has been the best experience I have ever had in my journey to learn how to program. Between the textbooks and other online courses, this is hands down my favorite experience.",5,False,BreadOne2Three,… And it’s all free,POSITIVE,"competit, streak, leaderboard, challeng"

Oh you one without wisdom. I have seen the light; I have been enlightened.” All that Mimo gives so freely couldn’t have been conceived in my wildest visions. Mimo... is like  heaven come to earth. It’s sleek design, a satisfying ui and, dare I say, Mimolicios leaderboard has inspired me each and every day to expand my brain capacity.  The Mimo experience; a hill with flowers atop, a place to call home, a place to call school. I have climbed passed my “peers”, with my intellectual prowess, easily shooting to the top of every leaderboard in my sight. I feel like a child, touching the face of God as my eyes are opened. This is what it all means. I feel like the summarians, national  superpowers that saw what the human capacity currently was, and didn’t except it: no, they rebelled against there primitive form and invented the basis for the advances we are able to make today. As I sit here, wrighting this reflection of the greatest peece of the puzzle that is our human experience: I reflect apon my life before Mimo, the melancholy state I was in. I don’t shame those who are experiencing a similar way of living; no, I call them, I offer them a hand  out of the dusty, well trodden rode they are crouched on, and say: “let me offer you something greater, something inspiring and powerful: let me grant you Mimo.”

I joined a coding bootcamp after finishing the HTML, CSS, JavaScript track on Mimo. I’ve been thriving there, and I strongly believe the exposure to programming I received on this app has facilitated my journey.

I bought the app during a Christmas deal, and it was worth it. Honestly, the full price would have been worth it, too. My main qualm comes from the fact that the content seems to have severely diminished in recent weeks. There used to be cool mini-courses on all types of different subjects, and I believe at one point early on when I first got the app, there was even a gallery to see top projects from others. Overall, I think the largest issue that will have to be addressed for Mimo to stay on the path of success and even burgeon in the future is communication and community. I feel like the dev team isn’t connected with the users. The social media hasn’t been active for years. The emails receive no responses and the bug reports may be harkened to, though there’s not even a ticket given in a courtesy email so one wouldn’t know. And, as for the community, I found several people who had used Mimo at my coding bootcamp which was really cool though it would have been nice to see an online community, both in the app and on related social media, both which are not the case.",4,False,Master Grant,A Great Beginning,POSITIVE,"social, point"

It’s been very simple and straightforward to grasp the lessons. Everything is broken down into small segments, so I can fit them in whenever throughout my day. The little encouragement of leaderboards and daily steak counters really works for my natural competitiveness. It pushes me to always fit in a least one or two lessons a day regardless of how busy I am. Which in turn, has me consistently learning and moving through the material. It’a like the Duolingo for coding, if anyone has used the language learning app. I’m curious to see how much I can learn and how far the lessons go. I haven’t subscribed or upgraded or anything yet, but I haven’t hit any real major limitations so far. I couldn’t tell you how advanced it is or gets because I’m a true novice.

I’m probably feeling more annoyed than usual because all the mistakes I made were on stupid things like “What is the display of feeling=“happy” .... print(feeling)” and then I put “happy” instead of happy. A bit annoying to say the least.

If you could shorten the time down to 1-2 hours I feel it would be perfect. That way it still pushes users to get premium without pushing them away. 2 hours each and users could wake up and practice after a full night of sleep. At around 5 hour/heart, you can only really use it once every 2 days or so.

However, there are a few things that I think needs to be changed.
First of all, the heart system. Seriously, whenever you make a mistake you have to wait 4 hours to keep coding? It seems kind of unfair. Mistakes are supposed to help you learn, not make you really nervous you’ll get a question wrong. I know this is so people will want to buy Mimo pro, but it’s still too much. At least make it so you have to wait less for another heart.
Second of all, the leaderboard has been glitching the past few days. Another reason I use Mimo is because I want to stay first on the leaderboard, but for some reason, it wasn’t updating. I clearly got more sparks in the past few days, but it isn’t showing on the leaderboard. Other people’s scores also haven’t been changing. Is this just something wrong with my device or is it a bug?

However, I didn't get feedback in the form ""that also works, but do it this way instead for now"", but rather a mere ""that's wrong"".

Or you could make it so that every time you lose five hearts, it takes away some points. The point of this game is I think to teach us about coding and it’s okay to make mistakes.

One or two mistakes are understandable but it’s nearing the point that you can’t trust that the examples are correct. The HTML lessons are 5 stars… The CSS stuff not so much.  It has become tedious in a way that doesn’t help you absorb the information. 

After introducing a new concept in CSS, questions ask you to continually regurgitate exactly what is shown rather than ask for a desired outcome.  Sometimes the choices are so glaringly obvious that you might not even need to read the question.  As stated earlier, it seems there’s a steep decline in content quality after the HTML section, which again was really great!  Nonetheless, I’m glad I paid, but especially for just a single month.

878,2022-04-28 00:14:47,,"This app is very helpful for grasping and visualizing the basics of programming. I love the mini apps it walks you through along the way because most of my discouragement while learning programming has been “okay… I know what this does… but what do I use it for?” Lol. The leader boards add a nice competitive touch that keep me engaged as well. The only negative thing I would say is that there can be an awful lot of hand-holding, even when you’re further into a topic. For example I was just going through comparisons in JavaScript and it spent several pages telling me how a greater-than (>) operator checks to see if one value is greater than another. But on the final page the instructions were “check if this number is greater than another *by typing >*”. Personally I feel like it’s harder to lock those ideas in because you don’t really have to. The instructions tell you exactly what you need to pass, and if you get an answer wrong it immediately corrects you by telling you the right thing to type. In one sense I understand you don’t want to make it too hard for beginners. But in another it almost feels like it removes the necessity for me to access my own memory and solve the problem myself. Like if I was learning math and something said, “Solve 5+5 by typing 10.” It feels disappointing at times because I’m thinking, “We’ll shoot. I would have liked to initiate my own brain resources to figure that out, but I’ve accidentally glanced at the answer by reading the question.” Lol. However, it should be noted that at later modules it does pull back and let you work things out by yourself a little more. So it’s not a COMPLETELY overbearing teacher. 

BESIDES that possibly minor nit-pick though, I really love this app. I’ve tried a few others and they don’t feel nearly as engaging. They tend to fall on the other side of the spectrum where they either just leave you hanging without much clue what to do. Or there’s no interactivity and it’s just strictly multiple choice questions. This app actually has you type things out (or select from predefined options, which is easier to handle on mobile).

1298,2020-06-17 09:07:17,,"I’ll preface this review with a fact about me; I rarely write reviews. It takes a lot for something to either wow me enough or disappoint me enough to leave a review. In the case of Mimo, it frankly has knocked my socks off! 

I’m using Mimo alongside precourse material for my upcoming bootcamp and honestly, it’s providing more information in a more accessible format. Everything is explained very well and delivered in a way that just clicks with how I learn. 

You’re also given the opportunity to really drill the information into your head by maxing out the stars. It can be a bit repetitive to do this but I actually think that’s a good thing; once I get annoyed with covering the same thing over and over I know I’ve got the knowledge. 

I’m always a bit hesitant with app based learning programs because I always feel like I’m going to get to the point where I want to learn more and then they’ll tell me that I need to upgrade. That’s not the case with Mimo! The free version is very robust and has all of the information on HTML, CSS, and JS that you need to get started. The only thing I can see that would require a membership is the projects which, while great, aren’t necessary to learn the information; mainly just practice. 

Unfortunately, I was planning on learning the material first and then tackling the projects but my discounted pro price expired. It’s all good though, as I said, the free version is great! There’s a small ad at the end of each lesson but they’re very easy to click out of and only last a couple of seconds. 

The only thing I’d like to see from Mimo is an option to access the lessons from a computer. Obviously, I’m not going to be doing web dev on my phone so it would be nice to get the practice in on desktop. Projects are available on desktop though so if I decide to spring for a pro subscription I will be taking advantage of that. 

I’ll end this with a thank you to Mimo for providing this amazing service! If you’re thinking about trying this app, absolutely go for it!

1375,2020-05-21 22:12:53,,"I came to Mimo as an absolute novice when it comes to coding. I had minimal experience with HTML and no experience whatsoever with any other coding languages. At first, I found the lessons fun and engaging, and within a couple of weeks I felt like I had a decent understanding of the basic mechanics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These principals are taught in bite-sized lessons, similar in structure to Duolingo. Two things the program does really well is providing side projects that allow you to apply your knowledge and skill challenges that allow you to test your understanding of the material. This is what drew me in initially.  

However, when I tried to dive deeper into some of the other lessons Mimo has to offer, I was incredibly disappointed by how shallow the material was. Their Python course, for example, is only spread out over 11 lessons, and there are none of the aforementioned skill challenges or side projects that allow you to solidify your knowledge. I had the same experience when trying to learn C#. It seems that they’ve put quite a bit of work into HTML, CSS, and JS, but not nearly enough into their other offerings. 

They have a system in place where you can repeat a lesson three times (which I only learned by contacting tech support - nowhere in the app does it tell you this), with each level supposedly being more difficult than the last. Except they’re not more difficult - it’s mostly just the same info, over and over again. Half of the questions tell you exactly what to do, so it feels more like rote repetition than actual learning. Overall, I get the sense that Mimo’s marketing strategy is to make it seem as though they offer more material than they actually do, and to stretch that information over as many units as they possibly can. 

I paid for a month of Pro, which I don’t regret. I got a lot out of this month of learning. But I feel like I’ve already hit a wall with what this app can offer me, and I don’t think I’ll be renewing.

I love the concept of this app and a lot of things are made quite clear and concise through the lessons. I found the introduction to hacking very straightforward. However, I see a _lot_ of mistakes in the lessons, especially typos or missing words in the exercises, which sometimes makes it unclear what the exercise is actually even about. I’ve been trying to report these kinds of things but have so far received no indication that my reports have even been received. I was also a bit disappointed by the need to pay $50/year in order to do just about anything in the app. You really should give a more in-depth preview before you force people to pay. Also, if you already have programming experience, it’s unclear if you can skip ahead to more advanced topics. Maybe the target audience is only complete beginners, but if that’s the case then the $50/year is _definitely_ not worth it. Also, as sort of a side note, the update notes here on the App Store are bugged out. How can you not have noticed that???
