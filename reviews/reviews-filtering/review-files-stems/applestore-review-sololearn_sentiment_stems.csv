Within maybe 10-15 minutes, I would exhaust their free content and would be pressed to upgrade to a pro account to learn any more.

It does have a pro version like the rest, but it doesnt appear to hold back content from non pro members.  It also has waaaaay more content to dive into compared to the others.

10,2019-04-13 18:17:42,"Overall this is a fantastic app and a fantastic system to be able to learn any of the programming languages offered. I would highly recommend it.

The one problem, however, is that the Community Forums use a ridiculously small font size on any device, with no way of enlarging it. This makes it practically impossible to read at length, no matter whether you are using an iPhone or an iPad. I use an iPad mini most of the time and reading the forums really hurts my eyes (I am 48 years of age and I don’t wear glasses). Just look at the screenshot provided in the app’s own description! The font size in the Community Forum is tiny and there is no button or setting placed anywhere to change it unfortunately.

The reason that this is such a disabling factor is that the community forums are integral to making progress in this app and are one of the most amazing and helpful things! Discussions are available for every topic and for every question and every answer. And that is just the most helpful thing you could imagine as you try to learn a new language.

So I pray that the developer adds the same button that is in the coding lesson text to the community forums to change font size.

1164,2020-09-05 16:06:48,"UPDATED REVIEW:
The developer seemed to have fixed whatever the ad issue was that I and several other reviewers pointed out. (Original review is below this one)

The only thing I find kind of odd is that the developer doesn’t actually publicly acknowledge the ad issue, just tells you to contact support. To what end? The issue is obvious?

Regardless of the obvious misstep by SoloLearn support in responding to reviews. As I stated in my original review, the app is quite good. I’ve used it a lot over the past several months and there’s a lot to like and it works fantastically as a means to support other more thorough learning methods (videos, books, mentors, etc.)

I definitely recommend the app as someone looking to add a mobile resource to their learning routine. 

My main suggestion to the developer is to give more time on the challenges and require the authors of the questions to add descriptions and explanations to help aid learning and not just offer competition. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
The newest update added a pretty awful feature. 

Ads that can’t be closed or skipped. You sit there looking at the ad thinking it’ll close in 30 seconds or so like every other free app... but no, you can sit there until the zombie apocalypse, it will never close. 

So now I get to force close the app every time I complete a section.

The app so far is great– it's beginner friendly and very step by step, and you're able to look at solutions for practices when you're stumped. There are comment sections on the lessons where you can find helpful information from other users. 

My only problems would be that the ""challenge weapons"" (what code you can use for special challenges) do not include Kotlin, which is the main language I am learning. Many of the solutions for practices do not include what the lesson taught (for example, the Kotlin practice example for filtering arrays does not use that command, instead going for forEach.) They do work of course, but it isn't helpful to see what you did wrong in implementing what you learned. 

A minor problem is there is no way to contact support within the app itself. There is an email and a way to do it through the site, but I would appreciate there being one in the app as well. I haven't contacted support for this due to forgetting my login information (the main reason I would like support within the app) so take it with a grain of salt as there might be a solution, but I bought the annual pro subscription and have not been able to access some of the features promised– the main one being seeing past errors in your practices rather than having them being locked.

This took considerable time and effort, as not understanding the basics had me searching the web or forums for answers to the most basic things - and even the ones who wanted to help, I couldn’t give context into what I was doing as I wasn’t the one who wrote the code to begin with.

I’ve tried learning from the roots, but everything out there was way too toddler style basic.  Even though I was a hack job of a programmer, I still had a good understanding of syntax.  When I found SoloLearn, and it’s community, I felt like I finally…FINALLY after all these years found a tool that teaches the basics but swiftly brings you up to intermediate and professional.

I forgot about this $65 subscription (after tax) & after seeing it in my bank statement (but playing with the app for a couple days), i realized this was an investment, not a mistake. 

Sololearn has quickly grown to become one of my most used apps on my phone & it’s not because of the extensive library of courses, not because of the ability to create an account & save your progress, not because of the ability to add, train, and compete with your friends. It’s mostly due to the comment section feature that has been added to each section/page of each lesson! I love the extra little ‘tips’ everyone has & all the motivation they give each other. 

I’d say this app has made it to stardom in my eyes simply for the classroom aspect of it all. it sure makes it feel like i’m in a class setting, knowing that I can filter the comments by most recent if needed, having multiple Pro teachers within that comment section also helps in situations where you can’t understand the lesson. 

I never once wanted to code because of how complicated everything seemed, how expensive schools were, and how niche it felt. I can’t express enough how natural I feel learning how to program through an app! I would have never imagined.

1410,2021-11-30 18:47:16,"This is a good app to learn coding, but as always, there is room for improvement. 

As part of the pros, you get to learn at your own pace (without the annoyance of running out of hearts to continue). In addition to that, there’s a whole learning community that you can ask for help in the comments section. It feels like a classroom group chat where people send how to reach the desired code and at times the actual code itself (can be considered a con if you intend to reach all solutions without giveaways). 

But as for the cons, it’s worth noting that an advertisement promoting SoloLearnPro continuously shows when reaching the Variables section (which is the third unit in Python Introductory course). This inhibits users abilities to further their knowledge of coding as learning to code requires hands on execution as well as Trial and Error. So by forcing the advertisement on users, the knowledge gained from that point moving forward is reading and occasional practice. It takes away from the example mentioned in the reading sections. For visual learners, it acts as a severe hindrance since it’s hard to retain an ample amount of words about coding rather seeing it in action. Also, a tutorial on how to return to the course learning section would be a nice touch. After reading the community posts and comments, it’s easy to get lost in it all. 

TL;DR 
So in other words, it’s like a written lecture where your college professor skims past each supplementary example slide that is supposed to accompany the lesson notes. Either you retain it or you don’t. There’s no examples shown after a certain point. Hence can be described as coursework or worksheet based learning. I hope to see the advert removed. Then, and only then can I rate this app five stars.

Edit: Upon scrolling through the comments and responses from the developers, I noticed something rather contradictory. The developers response to one reviewer says “that the entire content of SoloLearn is completely free” but in the app, a feature that was once free isn’t any longer after surpassing a certain point (From my experience it was Section 3: Python Variables.)

The Play Store via Android gives an ESRB rating of Teen (“Users interact.”) “Content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. [...]” which is a much more accurate assessment of age-appropriateness.

I’m a pretty novice programmer, so the tutorials for learning Java have helped me a lot. My favorite feature after the compiler is the challenges, which have helped me hone my skills and practice.

My only real complaint is that the Java compiler has a few bugs - less than other compilers I’ve tried, and they don’t interfere too much in terms of running, but they can make the code look messy. Firstly, if you open a parenthesis or brackets, a second one pops up closing it (which is great), but deleting the first before typing anything doesn’t delete the second, and if you add another parenthesis to close out of habit, it just adds another parentheses. Also, tabbing sometimes produces inconsistent distances, or tabs on the wrong line. On a related note, the default template that appears when you start a new editor uses small tabs, but most times when you tab in the document, it makes a big tabs. One more bug is that if you hit enter and quickly start typing, it sometimes rearranged the letters you type. Undoing with control-z doesn’t work either. Sorry if I didn’t explain these well, I can explain better if you need! These are using the first iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard, by the way.

This app fits what the user wants to do and presents options and at the end you get a certificate. This app is 10/10 💯 and I already go around raving about it and recommending it to everyone.

Feel free to ask questions too. The community is uber helpful. I also noticed that there are coding challenges as well and you can exhibit code you’ve created in the playground. I use this to review stuff on python I’ve forgotten after not having used the language for about 10 years and it’s been refreshingly helpful.",5,False,plainjosh,Great app,,POSITIVE,challeng
1638,2018-06-19 17:09:38,"SoloLearn is really good- you get tons of coding courses for free. I’ve been using it for about two years now and it has rarely failed me. I recommend it first to anyone who asks me where they should learn to code. 

The Q&A is well-moderated and the courses are in good detail for the most part. The playground is a great place to test your code. All in all, Sololearn is a great tool if you want to test something really quick, or refer to a course if you are looking for quick information. This is especially useful when you have the app.

However, there are one or two problems I might report here in order that it gets fixed. In the mobile app, when you have the keyboard down in a code and click the < arrow button, it sees I havent saved the code and asks me to name it and save it. This is really useful, because without it I would have had too many projects lost because I never saved. However, it never prompts you if you have the keyboard up. For example, I was working on a project for over an hour on my mobile, and was expecting it to ask me to save when I pressed the < button (I had the keyboard up) and it never prompts me to save so all my progress was gone, which I was not expecting to happen. 

Also, some courses aren’t complete. The PHP course is missing a lot of important shadings revolving around opening and closing files.

I had spent long hard hours staring at a simple python program wondering why it wouldn’t work. It was a simple program: you input into one file, and the program puts the result in the output file. What would be an easy file error fix took me hours to troubleshoot (who knew that file.read() closes the file, resulting in errors if you want to read the file line by line?). Just these small tidbits of advice in the courses can save programmers lots of time.",4,False,Bill1971MD,"Its great, some problems though",,POSITIVE,progress

1664,2018-04-14 22:06:10,"I really appreciate what this app is trying to do, but there are a number of things that really bothered me about it when trying to learn C++ and test code snippets:

1. iOS’ loupe is broken in the code editor.  It places the caret where your thumb is pressing, instead of the center of the magnifying glass, so you can’t see exactly where it will be located.  This is especially frustrating because...
2. The editor automatically adds closing parentheses, brackets, braces, and double quotes after the caret.  This is an infuriating “feature” that I turn off in every environment I use, and I haven’t found a way to turn it off here.  Because of this, I must relocate the caret on nearly every line, which when combined with item 1 makes this app completely useless as a mobile coding environment.

Regarding the lessons themselves.

3. I understand that c++ throws so much more at you than most other languages when you first step into it, and you want to simplify as much as you can, but I strongly disagree with how much the lessons insist upon the line ""using namespace std;"", which I've since learned is pretty widely agreed upon as bad practice.  Beginners should absolutely be exposed to using std::cout instead of cout in the global namespace, as it also serves as a handy reminder that the system header <iostream> needs to be included.

4. There needs to be a better way to skip modules.  By the time I installed this app, I was already familiar with most of what was covered in Module 1, and mostly needed to understand pointers and classes, but because I didn't know about prefix vs postfix increment/decrement operators and got one quiz question wrong, I had to trudge through 20+ quizzes consisting of ""type ""a"" into this blank: __"".

I would love to have an environment like this app to use my 2 hours of daily commute time learning and testing code, but my experience with c++ gives me the impression that other lessons on here will inculcate more bad habits I'll have to unlearn.",2,False,Paramesis,Frustrating Environment,,NEGATIVE,"habit, point"

The layout is great. It tells you where you are with learning the language and shows you a variety of languages to choose from. This is the strongest interface for people that want to learn how to code on their mobile device I have seen. It is also convenient to just hop on your phone and work on coding.

In addition to a great app, they have a strong community where you can engage with other coders/developers and receive feedback and tips. Once you are finished with one language, you complete challenges from the community.

1674,2018-02-28 13:23:33,"His app is awesome. It basically takes all the other SoloLearn apps and combined hem into one. Why download multiple apps for multiple languages when you can just get all the exact same lessons in one app! I wouldn’t recommend this for advanced programmers, but this is perfect for beginners who are just learning the ropes. This app even comes with it’s own coding engine so you can code in the app! If you are a teacher and only want to teach your students one language, then it makes sense to only have them get one of the other SoloLearn apps to make it simpler. But if you are just someone who wants to learn the ropes, then get this! It’s free, it’s awesome, and it’s never been easier to learn coding on the go. Perfect for people who don’t have much free time. I would recommend completing this course before going into other more advanced online courses. It also has a great, extremely helpful community. Even after you’ve completed the course, there are still fun things to do such as the coding playground. Recently they added other lessons create by users which is great, and there are also coding challenges which are basically quizzes against other players. It’s also 100% free!
