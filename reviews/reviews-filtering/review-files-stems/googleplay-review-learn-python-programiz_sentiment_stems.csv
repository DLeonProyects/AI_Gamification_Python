Like till chapter 4.3 it's free, then it ask for purchasing pro. Which is totally not a good point. Also videos available within chapters looks like the same words written in the chapter. Either read or go through the video all are same. So probably the same trend will be followed. On that basis, probably buying course is not good option. Need much improvements. 👍👍",1,25,pythonx_1.0.9,2021-06-19 16:04:24,"Hey mate, sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused. To us, user experience matters the most.

Very good easy to use interface. The only challenge, and thus the 4 stars instead of 5, is being able to verify things in the ""projects"". I went through the projects and had small issues that were hard to troubleshoot. It is very hard to follow word-wrapping versus new line (the challenges of a small screen). Plus it is easy to miss something as small as an ""f"" function added into a command, when you are learning that one might, or might not, be used. It would be great if there were links to be able to access the code that you are typing, instead of having to go through everything on the previous screens and the small snipits. I am not asking to have a website to support it, that would be too much, but a GIT repository with the project code would be perfect.",4,18,pythonx_1.0.8,2021-04-13 12:46:02,"Dear Bruce, We are thankful and we really appreciate your suggestion.
