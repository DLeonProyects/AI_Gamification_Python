So I used Mimo as extra revision and turns out that I got much better much quicker. A couple of points I'd like to make are 1. I went through the whole course till I got stuck not knowing there were 3 stars to get not just one. This needs to be made clearer maybe use empty stars and as you go through fill with yellow. 2. Apparently there is a desktop version but definitely not made clear in the app as typing with a keyboard would be handy.,5,0,2.27,2020-07-20 06:15:42,,,NEGATIVE,point

A bit confusing at first as a beginner with 0 knowhow (just very common knowledge) to pick which program to start with and figure out how they keep track of it all.

Whole sections won't accept the correct answer, or let you pass until you find out the bug. I can get through typing the f-bomb as long as I click ""see solution"" then progress. Correct solution will let you pass? Lol no. What kind of sucker expects correct syntax or their money's worth. For the money they're charging, having a javascript course devolve into uselessness, and not even working at all on Bluestacks, and working terribly on native android is disgraceful. Pros: attractive interface, enjoyable enough to use and probably good for total beginners who find programming daunting and are in a time crunch or hobbyists. If you learn well by rote this may help. Cons: That's all it is. Rote. You can parrot the answers because you answer the same question 50 times but do you really understand it on a deep level? Probably not. For the price I expect a full version in-browser or on Windows, especially now Bluestacks has failed me it is of no use to me on Android devices. The options to choose to answer with semicolon, comma etc are far too small and an accessibility nightmare. Buggy at times and rolls back on mini-lesson you just completed on a semi-regular basis (on both native Android device and Bluestacks) and update as I said the bugs are disgraceful. I'd hang my head releasing this for money As someone already proficient in HTML and CSS and some JS this is going to introduce you to basics and concepts. The jump from this to real world programming is going to be huge for a lot of people and I would say almost too steep - so just be aware of that and dont give up. You will need to move on the edx, Udemy or MS Learn to start more advanced problem solving and/or a lot of practice for real world application. You migh be able to read (some) code but writing your more advanced code is going to be beyond you without major further education imho. W3C schools is also your friend. The CSS section is far too basic and missing a lot of the better features of CSS3. HTML is also missing many elements and concepts - no site layout was properly covered. Judging by reviews, a lot of people are not even aware of this fact. You barely scratched the surface. Know this going in. It's a starting bite only. I want to love this. I like the concept, I like the design and I do enjoy it but I think for the price I expect better. I also echo the sentiment that review features are absolutely necessary to refresh and reinforce.

the price changes (lower) and then the math makes sense! So am I a dummy?

akin to apps like Duolingo. Reading the comments from other users about the 
need to pay in order to access more content... I can understand the 
disappointment but, hey if Mimo helps you learn how to code easily, it's a 
worthy investment. Not to mention it's good to reward the hard work of 
coders and others who provide such a teaching product as Mimo. That's just 
my two cents. I'm going to continue taking lessons. If I want to invest 
more in learning for myself and this app proves to be exceedingly useful, I 
don't mind pay a few bucks more for excellent material. One can of course 
accumulate free knowledge elsewhere but at least Mimo would have a complete 
curriculum all in one place. It takes too long to research through all the 
bad and good content... I'm finding that I don't have much time as I used 
to so I would rather much enjoy something that's high quality and in one
