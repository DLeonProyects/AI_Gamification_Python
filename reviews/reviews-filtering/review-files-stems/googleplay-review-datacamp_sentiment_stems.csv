Doesn't keep track of account progress between asset browser use and mobile app use. Also cannot access all courses you can from browser. Will update review as app changes are made, probably..",2,26,1.0.4,2018-01-10 13:00:02,"Hi! Thank you for your review. We are sorry to hear that you don't have the best experience. 

We are working hard on bringing more courses to the app, but as we want to make them to be as good on mobile as they are on web, it takes a lot of time. 

What should we improve to make the app worth 5 stars?",2018-01-11 03:45:33,NEGATIVE,progress
