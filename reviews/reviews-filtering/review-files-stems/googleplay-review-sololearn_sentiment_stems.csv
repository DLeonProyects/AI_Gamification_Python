The developers had the motto of free and quality education for all. Then they introduce the pro features, it's just reversing on their own words. The app no longer deserves to be called ‚ÄúLearn to code for free‚Äù as it isn't. This was the greatest app to learn programming; now it's just pay-to-unlock just like other apps.

It was sad to see that not only are a lot of the lessons out of order, but also inaccurate. For example, the operator precedence lesson for Python indicates that all boolean operators have equal precedence, when in reality they do NOT have equal precedence (Sololearn, I challenge you to go check the Python documentation and compare it to the erroneous guide you all posted). From greatest to least greatest precedence, the boolean operators should be ordered as: Not, And, Or. Fortunately, there are public comments for every single slide, so a lot of confusion is mitigated via these, but overall I can probably point out at least 5 to 10 other spots where a beginner would get easily confused by these lessons. If you want to truly learn programming, grab yourself a real, physical book, with legit examples and thorough explanations. It really doesn't cost that much...you'll thank not just me, but yourself later. Please thumbs up this review so that others striving to learn programming make the first step in the right direction as well - a physical book with proper lessons, not these terribly ordered quick concept cards occasionally sprinkled with misleading information.",2,10,2.3.1,2018-09-06 18:27:12,"Thanks for your report.

The design is very intuitive, offering the various languages, challenges and community Q&A right from the home screen. The app also offers achievement levels based on your completed challenges and activity in the forums. In addition to the navigation on the homescreen there is also a search function that allows you to see all of the topics based on your search criteria.   This is a great tool to get kids interested in programming in school. The flexibility of the mobile application means that any device can be used to teach you the basics.

The xp system is also nice it encourages myself to see my progress and rate myself too .  I was scared of coding always run from the programs because i  was never able to understand them now the change is that I am always wants to face them .

There is also no followup or revision testing as there is in Enki (though Solo Learn is superior in every other way).  It does make sense to have progression be simple and easy (it drives engagement and ensures people stick with the app/course - Duolingo does this extensively).

The interface is decent, the lessons are presented in small chunks, which aided the learning process, and the encouragements are helpful.  Some explanations and examples could have been more clear, but the comments and community help a lot. This is the case with many courses - you usually have to go cross-referencing with other sources of information and learn from other learners. I really like the playground area - it is a must to try coding examples as part of learning a language. To be able to do all of this from my phone is great. I took the Python course to get an overview of the language. I usually just dive into examples when I need to use an unfamiliar tool, but I wanted to get a better grounding this time, and SoloLearn worked for me. Learning Python is a step in a larger plan to learn to utilize machine learning. A machine learning course would be great, maybe even TensorFlow.  At any rate, I would recommend SoloLearn as a quick and convenient way to learn the basics of Python.

The code playground is great for testing code on android. The small size of this program is a huge bonus as well. The comments on the tutorials are very helpful. However as far as learning different languages the tutorials could use some work. The examples are to short to few to grasp concepts without having to use other resources to understand them. Often times the answers they ask you after each tutorial can be completely unrelated to the current tutorial.  All of this review is based off completion of one language (Java). I will likely edit my review once I have more time with this app. Oh and before I forget the app asking me for a review several times before I finish a tutorial is slightly annoying. This may seem like a negative review but overall I must say I am very pleased with this app. I just wanted to give some positive criticism so hopefully some of these issues can be addressed.  7/3/17 - After a few months of using this app I felt like an update to my review was appropriate. Some of my previous issues with the app still apply most don't, for example it still asks me to review the app in the middle of tutorials. But that is such a minor annoyance compared to everything this app has taught me. The courses I talked about on my previous review about unrelated tutorial questions isn't so bad now since they keep adding new things to the tutorials and adding new tutorials too! With all that being said this app deserves more than the 5 stars I can give it.

Very well organized content, both in terms of how the notions are presented, and interactivity by inserting mini-tests throughout every chapter.  Important to mention here is the ""try-it yourself"" code module, which allows users to write their own code.  Then, the comments section, in which one can read other people opinions and write their own comments and questions. And the challenge-tests, they are both fun and instructive.  Then, I believe the ""incentive"" system with points, badges, etc is very well thought, to motivate the person who is learning. It is also very useful that it is one single app that integrates all the courses, instead of having separate apps for java, html, css etc. Though the level of the notions presented in these courses is far from being called advanced or comprehensive, the app does a very good job at initiating one in html, css, java, sql, etc. After one completes a course in SoloLearn, will be much easier to read and *understand* online documentation.

This app is fantastic. Super clear, teaches and asks questions, has an embedded IDE and compiler so the UI is clean and easy. There is a social component in the sense that people comment with questions and answers right within the page you're looking at so if you have a problem you can just ask/read what people have to say. Judy an all around quality app. Will be using it to learn all the languages. Thanks so much to the developers‚Äã!",5,5,1.3.3,2017-05-13 23:46:56,,,POSITIVE,social

It fosters a false sense of accomplishment.  The educational experience is reduced to a game in which you seek levels of experience to unlock badges.  It does not foster deep understanding of basic and vital concepts such as the importance of code hygeine for readability and maintainability.  The user-submitted challenges are often so poorly formatted or unrealistically convoluted that you run out of time trying to decipher them, but those who are rewarded care nothing about making quality code and haven't got a thorough understanding.  The examples and quizzes are far too trivial.  The comment sections are too short and with no character count to indicate when you exceeded size, so that when you submit 20 minutes worth of finger diddling your mobile device, it just drops your submission saying No Connection with no chance to go back and edit.  That said, the platform itself is designed well enough to deliver content of this nature.  But they need to develop more competent material and pedagogical technique, and cover meta-topics such as build systems, design patterns and code hygeine.
