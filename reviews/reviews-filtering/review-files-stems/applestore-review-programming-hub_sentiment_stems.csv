I’m a complete noob in IT, programming, Coding, hacking, all of it. But, always had a huge interest in learning and knowing how to completely understand, build and use a computer, network, internet, virtual machines and websites. Though I don’t think I’m anywhere near knowledgeable enough to land any entry level job into any of the related fields, this app has really made learning the basics super user friendly and easy to comprehend. I’m not sure yet how in depth some of these courses go. But, I’ve started with the basics so far and can say I’ve grasped it all and retained most well. Which has always been hard for me. I bought the pro version, so I get certificates at the end of each course. I’m sure they’re not accredited with any sought after employers or firms but stepping stones towards the knowledge needed then applied in real life as practice would likely be sufficient in a year or two with consistent effort every day, multiple times a day in this app. I’m on day 2, completed 2 courses (fundamentals and SEO), I just started my 3rd (IT Basics) and don’t plan on stopping until every course is completed.

To me, the point of language is to convey ideas, so it doesn’t matter if you use the wrong “your” or say ain’t, but some of these statements in here have to be read several times to make sense. Lots of typos. For bugs, my courses don’t track progress correctly. I refresh and the percentage hops around, even if I’ve completed the course. Completed courses don’t show up under completed. I’ve done six or seven and only one is there. I can’t change my name or picture even though I’m typing in my password correctly. I think the save button doesn’t work in the top right corner.

I want to help with the advancement of medicine. But, I thought that programming language was hard to understand, or complicated, with all those tags and everything. I’ve tried some things. Did not work very well. So, I one day decided to browse through the App Store, bored, finding what could be right for me. But then, this app caught my very eye.

I thought that this app was another boring old app that is just like any other; repetitive, boring, and unteachable. But, I got it anyway, to see how it worked out. And do you want to know what I thought? This is actually fun and educational!

It breaks lessons thoroughly and easy. It gives you a mini lesson about that sub-lesson to that big lesson on this giant app. You guys made this app fun! I’m learning JavaScript, and it breaks it up step by step. No wonder it has so many 5 star ratings!

There is a little room for improvement. For example, where is intermediate? You go from beginner to advance. Where is that? There is no in between! Also, you could make more categories. It’s just tedious finding the course you want. Then, if you can’t find it, you have to search it, and what if you can’t remember the name! Please consider this as constructive feedback and not critical.

Anyways, back to the pros. Love the pictures to go along with it! It really helps with the research part if you wanna do apple or AI or C++ and so forth!

*Extensive: this app offers the most 📑🗂 content for the least 💸cost. Including certificates of completion, after a daunting but incredibly thorough course log (which, the certificates of completion were a personal priority). However if you ARE GOING to pay MONTHLY INSTEAD Of annually or a lifetime cashout, then i *definitely recommend subscribing to something like “Knowin” 1st** since it is composed of much shorter & potentially easier courses that APPEAR to be designed as a prerequisite for completion before the purchase of something like this (in order to speed up the pace of completion when the duration has a direct affect on the cost per year etc.). 
*In general, it depends on personal priorities.. but when this opt was compared to the similar alternatives in the top charts, this one does come out a little a little bit longer per course, but the service provider does offer a ‘lifetime’ subscription option (which I selected in hopes they do not suddenly discontinue operations). Specifically, I chose the Lifetime opt. as it does not add direct pressure to the causative correlation between *time & money (as with monthly memberships).

The best part is that once a concept is covered, you take mini quizzes (don’t worry if you get them wrong, they’re not graded as they are meant to help you solidify the concepts better.)

Update 8/1 - I think the additional canned messages from the developer asking me to reach out to the customer service team, the one that’s not been fixing my issue for over a month and making the situation worse is telling. Having working in CS I’m seeing no good processes here for proper escalations or handling of issues that have clearly gotten out of hand for a customer.

At some points with very little explanation it can make a whole lesson confusing for example coding a web page and the lesson tells you to insert a certain code or edit part of the code but doesnt say where it belongs or where it needs to be changed in script as your trying to code yourself following instructions given by lesson.
