It is not syncing my learning progress between my two phones and desktop, so I have to take the same courses again and again! I cannot change my name in the profile settings, and I can only update correct name on mobile. So if I happen to compete the same course on desktop - it shows the incorrect name. I was enjoying the app but for some weird reason the text-to-speach function just STOPPED and it never started again - not even on another course, and yes I did check my phone settings they were fine. Content is extremely basic ! I purchased the lifetime plan and I am really regretting this now. Started off as a nice app with potential but it turned out to be a huge waste of time. How on earth can I trust those people to teach me codding when they cannot even sort out their own app and website - BEFORE starting to charge people !!!

access to all the courses, and I strongly advise others NOT to waste their 
money. I downloaded this to refresh my memory of Java and possibly learn 
some new languages, so my review is based on the Java Basic and Java 
Advanced courses. For many reasons, this app was disappointing: * the 
courses are VERY BASIC. They assume you know nothing about programming, not 
even what a variable, a conditional statement, or a loop is. Despite the 
fact that the app has a free Fundamentals course which explains all the 
basics of programming like what a variable and an array are, the Basic Java 
course assumes you don't even know what a programming language is! * the 
explanations are SLOW and seem designed for children rather than adults. 
For instance, the fundamentals course explains that you can tell the 
computer to save information as a variable by first saying, ""Hey computer: 
Remember 'John' as my name."" A few pages later, it says, ""Uh Oh! In 
computer language, labels have to be single letters or single words."" So 
not only is the program full of childish wording like ""Uh Oh!"" and ""Oops!"" 
but it took multiple pages to explain what a variable is and how it is 
named. Another example of this is at one point in the Java course the print 
function is introduced very simply, as ""print"" or something "" then a few 
pages later you're told that, in the first example, the author didn't tell 
you how the actual Java code writes a print statement (System.out.print() ) 
because the author didn't want to scare you! * the advertising ""unlimited 
compilations: compile and practice your code with no restrictions"" is 
grossly MISLEADING. If there is a ""playground"" compiler for freewriting and 
practicing code, I haven't been able to find it, and the course itself is 
mostly explanations and quizzes, with almost no coding. The only ""coding"" 
you get to do in the Basic Java course is editing the content of a string! 
That isn't useful coding practice. * the content is written in CONFUSING 
ENGLISH. If the writing quality were better, I might be able to recommend 
this course for children or nervous adult beginners with zero programming 
exposure who want a gentle introduction, but the clumsy grammar and awkward 
wording may confuse children and those new to English. For Americans, the 
language barrier is complicated by the fact that this is written in (very 
poor, as I said) British English, so some of the words may seem flat out 
wrong or confusing, such as saying ""revise"" instead of ""review"" and calling 
""parentheses "" ""curved brackets"". If you (or your children) are brand new 
to programming concepts, I recommend Grasshopper which also moves slowly, 
but is more entertaining and interactive, has an easily accessible 
""playground "" compiler for free practice, is written in straight forward 
English, and is free. It's a great way to learn about loops, if statements, 
etc., in an engaging and risk-free way. If you already know the basic 
concepts and want to learn a real programming language like Java or C++, 
etc. (Grasshopper uses JavaScript), there are places on the web to learn 
and practice for free, even though they may not be as convenient as an app, 
if you want to use your smartphone and practice on the go. Edited to add: 
because of the lack of interactivity and the poor English, you're better 
off buying a book.",1,0,4.2.1,2018-06-09 15:15:18,"Dear Julia,

C and C++ seem arbitrary. The ‚ÄúCourses‚Äù don't really seem like courses, they tell you the basics of concepts like pointers but once you finish the course all that's left to do is visit the ‚Äúlearn‚Äù section. In the tutorials they are not really tutorials, it's just a reference, similar to an instruction manual rather than actually teaching you what a command would be useful for it only tells you what the command does. E.g. in what cases do I need to change addresses of pointers? Why would I need to use pointer to pointer, or pointer to structure, rather than just accessing the value directly? These kinds of in depth questions will improve the learning material. I hope in the future there will be user input required in the tutorials section to help the learner understand concepts better, and also to help the learner understand how they can use different commands in conjunction to make a program. Please keep improving this app, the format is great but the content feels too unguided for learners, it will help if there are more beginner tips etc. Written in the tutorials.
