I greatly appreciate that you can use Encode even offline. (It being offline also means that it can't load the ads, if you find that annoying.)

The lessons included are indeed simple, and I absolutely think if you're an intermediate study in JavaScript or HTML/CSS you won't get much out of this. But as a beginner cramming these lessons in to/from work, who was only ever able to make good old 90's GeoCities webpages at best, the bite-sized chunks it's broken down into makes computing language much easier for to process.

The extra challenges as reinforcement and the compound lessons putting everything together is worth the $4.99 unlock, but even if you're looking to just start learning for free you could do much worse than Encode.",5,False,jellocube,Perfect for beginners!,,NEGATIVE,challeng

It’s extremely good at putting vocabulary into Layman’s terms to help you understand everything you’re doing. It also breaks things into very small chunks that are in and of themselves easy to learn, and then builds on.

148,2022-05-30 14:38:05,"I am a total beginner at coding and downloaded this app, as well as a few others. I want to say before giving my complaints/suggestions that this IS a decent way to memorize how to code. It doesn’t feel so much like learning through practice so much as learning through reading. It’s still informative and teaches you to code and what everything (well, most things) is for and how/why/when/where to use it. 

First off, just a minor suggestion for the devs: this app doesn’t keep score or reward  your progress really, other than ticking off the lessons you’ve completed, which is fine honestly, it’s certainly not a dealbreaker, but I think it does make learning apps like this more enjoyable and fun to use. 

Second, the lessons feel a bit condescending sometimes. The way the answers to the questions are usually just the value of one of the blank spaces of the code and you just tap it and it appears in the space, and a lot of times it’s just one space that needs to be filled in so it just feels like “what’s the point in me tapping the ONLY answer there is, and having it just appear in the blank space?” Feels a little kindergarten to me. And again, it DOES educate you on coding, it’s just more of a READING way of learning, like reading a slightly interactive book basically, where sometimes you need to fill in one of the sentences with the word(s) that belong there…literally. 

Third, and this is again just another personal opinion/suggestion based on preference, but the app just feels very plain and basic I guess is the best way to describe it. There’s just really no “pop!” or personality to it. And I understand it’s an app about learning how to code, and code is often very plain and boring and concise looking, so I understand it not being anything crazy, I just wish there was a little more personality to the app and that it was a bit more interactive than it currently is. As mentioned above, there’s no reward or incentive for doing anything on there, which is fine, the learning of new things about coding is absolutely a reward in itself. However, it would be nice to have a little more feeling of connection and interaction with the app and a little more incentive and personality. 

I don’t mean to sound like a complainer just being captious about the app and picking it apart. I do appreciate the dev(s) taking the time to create this app to help people learn to code, because it is a nice little interactive textbook of coding information at this point, and it is appreciated being provided with that information. I just wish it didn’t feel so condescending and plain. With a few little tweaks I really think this app could be amazing because it does explain things very simply and easy to understand and learn. 

Thank you! If you made it this far and read the whole review, you’re beautiful and I wish you all the best in life and in coding!!! <3€><>

156,2021-01-13 21:18:58,OK I just started using this app and it’s good but I understand that you want to make lessons  but you don’t have to keep popping up ads there can be in app purchases so people could actually buy them and have fun and create it into a game into a find a little game not for just school and stuff it could be fun coding game and you can make like little obstacles for The user if they’re competitive like you can code a little character to walk to certain things like walk to school and there could be arrows pointing up down left right and you have to code the character to get to school and you like win prizes for playing the mini games also it could still be a educational app by putting quizzes and making sure that you’re reading the directions I understand that you want to make things fun and you already have quizzes in your game but every 20 minutes you should at least make a littleQuiz for the player to answer and you would get a reward and you to get tokens to play mini games also you could choose if you are playing from school or home and if you were playing from school it would be educational and if you were playing from home you could choose if you were home school or just for fun those are my ideas I hope you include them it’s OK if you don’t anyway I hope you enjoyed reading this review❤️,5,False,Kitty cupcakes thousand and 12,Good and I have a couple ideas,,POSITIVE,"competit, point"
164,2020-01-17 04:34:11,"This app is my favorite! I am 13 years old and want to be a coder when I am an adult. My school does not have any coding electives. This is a disappointment, as I really want to learn more. As a last resort I came to the App Store in hopes of finding something that could teach more about code than I already know. I was surprised to find many apps for coding most seemed very basic and somewhat like they were designed for 3rd graders. But then I found this app. I came to learn more complex code, and that is what I got. I do not recommend this app if you are a beginner at coding. But if you are really into it like me than definitely use this app. I love it!!!!! Or in code

175,2017-09-28 11:30:06,"I'm not extremely talented at writing code, but I do understand how to copy a few words and characters, which is what I did, but to my surprise it gave me an error that I can't even comprehend.

I don't recall what exactly it was, but it included the number 23, line, and syntax error. If this is supposed to be a feature, I find it extremely puzzling as to why it would be added as an error message to people just starting out with coding.

Soon after that, I clicked the hint button, or whatever you call the button that fills in the code for you, and I ran it, and it came out fine with the preset Charles Babbage. (Glad you put that in there, I was extremely inspired by his work on the analytical engine.) I guess I should mention that this is in JavaScript: Variables I. After that, I tried once more typing in the line of code, and fortunately, it didn't come up with the strange error, it came up with ""undefined"". I even ended up trying to replace Charles Babbage with my name, and it still came up with ""undefined"". Another thing to mention, was that it was completing the Topic.

I haven't progressed much more into the app after that unfortunate encounter, but I would like to say that the interface is very clean, simplistic, and modern, and it also is very easy to navigate, but there is a feature that I would like to see added, and that is to be able to close out of the text editor without having to press run. It's not a very big deal, but I believe it would help a lot of people trying to go back and see a previous example of what they are supposed to be coding without having to run their current code they have written.

I really hope to see this app progress, as I believe it has lots of potential, and can be beneficial to people of all wanting to learn how to start coding HTML/JS/CSS.

Side Note: As I said earlier, I'm nowhere near tech-savvy, so I might be missing something and making a giant fool out of myself by posting this, so please give me some slack if it turns out to be nothing but my inability to grasp new concepts.

The flag button is located at the top of every lesson.\n\nIn terms of the better error messages for incorrect user JavaScript code, we're working on a new way to run JavaScript that will be ready soon.
