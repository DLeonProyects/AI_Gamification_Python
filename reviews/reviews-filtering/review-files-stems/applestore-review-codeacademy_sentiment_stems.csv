1)Review question text not populating correctly — literally says BLANKBLANKBLANK

3)Review question answer fields not populating correctly after pressing desired answer — answers frequently do not populate the answer fields 
4)No lesson structure or save state — every time you come to the app you are just getting random flash cards of information, there is no structured progression.

The app has that generic option of making the screen larger to fit the screen size. However it does not allow landscape mode which makes having a keyboard useless.

28,2019-01-17 14:25:31,"I’m very pleased with my Pro membership online, but this app is a disappointment. I thought it would be a teaching app, but actually it is only for review — each session presents a few (five or so) random concepts, in no particular order, then quizzes you on them. 

There’s no back-catalogue or list of lessons to access, as I had expected. Which means you have no control over what concepts are being thrown at you in each session. Like I said, it’s completely random. 

So, if you already know your stuff, it’s a fun way to prove to yourself that you’ve got skillz — but if you’re trying to learn a new language or set of skills, you will quickly find yourself under water.
