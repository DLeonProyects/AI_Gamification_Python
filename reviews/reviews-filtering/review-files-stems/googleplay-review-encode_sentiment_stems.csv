It introduces each concept in a concise, step-by-step manner and provides regular practice exercises along the way - all of this helps the user memorize syntax, but also helps the user understand each aspect of the concept b/f moving on. For example, the app introduces variables by defining what a variable is, telling the user how to declare a variable, and giving the user practice with declaration before explaining assignment. The user then learns about assignment, and then gets practice with that b/f learning how to retrieve values. If you're familiar with programming this might come across as repetitive or too basic, but the gradual progression and regular opportunities for practice/review is crucial to helping beginners fully grok the fundamentals and recall key concepts, while avoiding confusion/frustration.  While I'm not new to programming, I downloaded this for extra practice, to familiarize myself with JavaScript syntax, and to review general programming constructs/concepts (ex. I appreciate that it eventually explains things like function scope and OOP).   While I don't think I'm its target audience, I think this app is better from a pedagogical POV, and uses the app form better than than a lot of the ""learn to code"" apps out there, which are often too ""textbook-like"" in their presentation. For example, I've encountered many ""learn to code apps"" that present concepts as dry walls of text, and/or introduce too many concepts at a time (if you're using an app you're probably just using it to pass time for a couple minutes, you're not really intending to get into a full study session - so this app's ""bite sized"" presentation is better tailored to how people actually use apps.) Also, many other apps  don't provide much in the way of practice/exercises (and/or the exercises aren't validated/""graded"" - newbies need the feedback that comes from ""graded"" exercises.). Also, the examples are presented in a fun/mildly humourous way. It takes what apps are good at (instant gratification and fun, short games), and uses that to help users learn - which is a feat that many ""learn to code"" apps haven't achieved.   It would be great if the authors/devs extended support for other languages (e.g. Ruby, Python).",4,5,3.4,2017-08-31 15:19:03,,,POSITIVE,progress

The description says it is POWERED by JavaScript  (which is both obsolete and just overall regarded as one of the worst languages in the coding community) and does not actually specify how to implement any of the code, how to run it, or again, what language. Does it need a compiler? Does it need an IDE? Does it run in a virtual machine like Java or on the hardware like C++? I have so many qustions, but there's nothing to indicate anything. Now, if it's all in the paid version, that's just low. Teach a person a language they can't use. Though, the Web section did save the app two stars. That was a lot more straight forward. Overall the UI looked good. But there's just so much missing that leaves the user who actually wants to use the language for something unsure of everything. They know a language, but not the name, or in what cases you should use it. Also, I feel ""this is a string. A string is letters in quotations"" is not the best way to teach. Maybe explain when it's used. I mean, I already know what a strong is because of my background in c++ and python and java, but people that are seeking a skill they have no experience with, they probably won't know a great deal. Yeah, you can amke a sentence without using ""char a = 'a';""",2,0,,2017-04-27 10:04:14,,,NEGATIVE,virtual
