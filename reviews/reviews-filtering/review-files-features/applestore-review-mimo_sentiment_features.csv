However, you are told exactly what to do each step of the way, or given choices that are far too obvious. Challenges are crucial for learning, and the app creates virtually no challenges for you. Rather than say ""Achieve result X by putting THIS before THAT"", it would be more challenging and more educational to have an instruction in the form ""Achieve result X by using what you've learned in this unit"" This might be wrong, because I don't know the rules of Pyhon, but I intuit that the app just punished me for doing something logical: I was supposed to write a ""while loop"" in the form ""while variable == True"", which I'm pretty sure is equivalent to ""while variable"", which is what I did. However, I didn't get feedback in the form ""that also works, but do it this way instead for now"", but rather a mere ""that's wrong"". Even the early platforms like codecademy have had this good fuzzyness since the beginning.",3,False,Albertoeda97,Too much handholding,NEGATIVE,Challenges
