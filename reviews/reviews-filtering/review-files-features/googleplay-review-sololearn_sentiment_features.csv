And there are no way to flag any question for support to check or exclude.  There were questions I wanted to investigate further, but app does best for you not to - after time is out it automatically switches to next question, you cannot save it or pause challenge and it won't ask you if you are ready for next question nor give you opportunity to answer question just to check if you had right answer in mind. It does everything to make you don't care.
