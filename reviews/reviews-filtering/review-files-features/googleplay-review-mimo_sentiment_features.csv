Mi feedback es que en los Projects no ayuden tanto y que en los Challenges ( que si son mas dificiles) ponga alguna opcion que te vaya dando pistas de poco a poco.",4,0,3.70.1,2022-02-24 07:27:25,,,POSITIVE,Challenges

I don't see the point of having a suggestion thread when they don't add highly voted suggestions such as Dark mode etc. Looks like the developers are only making the app to work or look based on their own ideas and not what the users really want. Challenges can be very repetitive. A subscription doesn't really give you more content.",3,101,3.34,2021-05-18 09:10:40,,,NEGATIVE,Challenges

Challenges are also paid. Deleted after 5 minutes of using it. Too greedy model.
