Characters that disappear or get overwritten, cursor often jumps back to the start of the line. Often won't accept exclamation from the keyboard, need to use the special mimo character keyboard. Often tells me I'm offline when I have full bar 4G connection. Just done the python course so far, quite a few errors in the content and questions. The last lesson on classes is full of mistakes.
