I tried using Sololearn for 2 days. I got through about 4 chapters. The examples and questions in the various sections were so easy to understand. But the projects were so hard. I would start a project and have no idea where to begin, super demoralizing. 

Also, it was really awkward to go back to previously covered material while you are in a project. 

I’m a beginner. I could use hints and tips when I’m stuck. Motivational quotes like “Learn from your mistakes” started driving me crazy.

“ if you are a child under thirteen (13), please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any personal information.”

The Play Store via Android gives an ESRB rating of Teen (“Users interact.”) “Content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. [...]” which is a much more accurate assessment of age-appropriateness.

The Age Rating these marketplaces assign to its apps are not the fault of the app developers, so given a (truer) target audience of 13+, I think this app deserves 4 stars.

- Features great concepts which never seem to reach their full potential, no matter how many revisions the UI/UX seems to endure

- Incentives structure (badges, XP, followers, popularity algorithms, etc.) continues to be problematic as an education app like this should emphasize and reward learning to code instead of simply indiscriminate increase in participation regardless of the kind of participation ... it can be very easy for younger learners to become engrossed in the non-coding related aspects of the platform

- Conscientious curriculum design is still a work-in-progress ... many courses still feel like the information provided is arbitrary, incomplete, and occasionally erroneous

- Division of subscription-based features vs free features also doesn’t make sense (seems arbitrary) with the exception of the subscription removing ads",4,False,GlaiveLady,Age Rating (@Parents),,NEGATIVE,Incentives
