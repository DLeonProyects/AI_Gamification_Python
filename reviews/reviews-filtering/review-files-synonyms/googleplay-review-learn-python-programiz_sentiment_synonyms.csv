The bug that wouldn't allow me to take final test was actually fixed after Uninstaller and reloading app. Instead of showing that I didn't complete courses 23 and 24, it instead showed that I didn't complete course 20. Found it only by going to menu on top right. Then pressed the icon for my profile. Then saw 23 instead of 24 achievements unlocked. Then pressed the ""Achievements"" button. Scrolled through and found one grayed out. Pressed it and re-completed it. BAM!!! Fixed!!!",5,15,pythonx_1.1.7,2022-10-22 00:22:48,"Dear Friend, We apologize for the inconvenience caused and the delay in response, kindly get in touch with us at hello@codingx.app along with the screenshot of the error, our team will check out the issue and fix it at the earliest. -HSG
